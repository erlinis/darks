Chrome extension that transforms a webpage into a rough dark mode.

It is inspirated by the dev.to article [Dark Mode with only 1 CSS PROPERTY](https://dev.to/dip15739/dark-mode-with-only-1-css-property-17fl)

## Disclaimer

Web pages can be built in many different ways so this extension is not a silver bullet for everypage.
